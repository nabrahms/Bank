Project Description - What is the high level idea of your project? This should be similar to your daily log submission (but could have changed). 2. Project Design - lower-level description. a. What technologies will you use, how will they integrate? b. What are the project’s use cases? c. Any other design docs that are necessary for me to understand your project 3. Project Schedule - what will you have done at each checkpoint? What will the final project look like? 4. Project Justification - why is your project interesting? a. Novelty - why is your project different than existing applications, and why should people use it? b. Complexity - why is this project a good showcase of your abilities?

1.	My idea that I have would be a bank transferring application. 
It will simulate as an application similar to Venmo, giving the user a “balance” where they can request or send money to and from other users.
It will also show a credit score based on the user’s spending habits.
2.	Lower-level description
a.	It will implement MySQL in order to save the bank and user data. 
It will also involve password hashing so that it is secure to each user, and will prevent any online attacks (such as SQL injections, ARP poisioning, DDoS attacks, etc.).
It will also use SpringBoot, as well as many HTML pages using thymeleaf. I will have to change the main database from H2 to MySQL.
b.	Use cases include: 
receiving and sending money, 
checking account balance, 
checking a set credit score based on spending habits and watching it increment/decrement.
c.	The credit scores will be made with a base of 650 and will go up and down depending on the amount that you receive vs. the amount you spend
3.	I should have the home page with empty links up 2 weeks after spring break. 
For the next checkpoint (Checkpoint 1), I will have a registration/login use case made. 
For Checkpoint 2, I will have the web application send and receive money, as well as check the users’ balance. 
For Checkpoint 3, I will have the credit score ready and will tweak the application so that it looks nicer. 
For the final project, I will make sure that everything works seamlessly as well as make the application look aesthetically pleasing. 
The final project will have a modern-feel UI where users can do simple bank actions in an aesthetically pleasing way.
4.	Project justification
a.	This application will work similarly to Venmo, having a balance as well as transferring money to and from other users who use this. 
However, this will be exclusive to the server. That way, it will surely not be attacked from any outside sources. 
It also will take more precautions on security with hashing passwords in a MySQL database. 
People should use it to not only give/receive money, but to see how that influences their credit score. 
It is a good preview of an important tool that we will need in the future.
b.	I believe that this will show everything that I have learned in this class from simple network programming, to Spring MVC, to using MySQL. 
This will also test my security abilities with hashing the passwords as well. 
I believe that this will be an application that I can proudly talk about in job interviews in he future
